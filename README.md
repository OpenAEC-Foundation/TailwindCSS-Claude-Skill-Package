**0 deterministic Claude AI skills for Tailwind CSS. Deterministic Claude skills for Tailwind CSS v3.4 and v4 : utility classes, config, variants, plugins, JIT engine, migration**

Built on the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.org) open standard. Discoverable via npm-agentskills manifest and OpenAI Codex skill discovery.

## Why This Exists

Without skills, Claude lacks deterministic guidance for Tailwind CSS patterns:

```{{LANGUAGE}}
// Wrong : {{WRONG_PATTERN_DESCRIPTION}}
{{WRONG_CODE_EXAMPLE}}
```

With this skill package, Claude produces correct patterns:

```{{LANGUAGE}}
// Correct : {{CORRECT_PATTERN_DESCRIPTION}}
{{CORRECT_CODE_EXAMPLE}}
```

## What's Inside

| Category | Count | Purpose |

| **impl/** | 0 | Step-by-step development workflows |
| **errors/** | 0 | Error handling, debugging, anti-patterns |

## Skill Structure

Every skill follows 3-level progressive disclosure:

```
tailwind-{category}-{topic}/
├── SKILL.md              # Main guidance (< 500 lines)
└── references/
    ├── methods.md        # Complete API signatures
    ├── examples.md       # Working code examples
    └── anti-patterns.md  # What NOT to do (with explanations)
```

YAML frontmatter uses folded scalar `>`, "Use when..." opener, and a `Keywords:` line with technical + symptom-based + plain-language terms for maximum discoverability.

## Quality Guarantees

- **Deterministic language** : ALWAYS / NEVER, no "you might consider"
- **Version-explicit code** : every example annotated with applicable versions
- **WebFetch-verified** : all code-snippets validated against official docs
- **CI/CD validated** : frontmatter, line count, structure, language, em-dash checks on every push
- **Compliance audit** : score >= 90% required for releases

## Companion Skills : Cross-Technology Integration
